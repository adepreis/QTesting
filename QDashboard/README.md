- Slide to the right/left or use the right/left arrows to move the dash panes.
- Use up/down keys to control the speedometer.

_(The GUI's width and height is dimensioned to be used with an official Raspberry Pi touchscreen)_

_Note : You have to exit the app using `Alt+F4` because there is no title bar._
